  GovukUnicorn.configure(self)
  ```
* If the app has the following, remove it:
  ```rb
  # Load the system-wide standard Unicorn file
  def load_file_if_exists(config, file)
    config.instance_eval(File.read(file)) if File.exist?(file)
  end
  load_file_if_exists(self, "/etc/govuk/unicorn.rb")

### How to upgrade

* Remove `gem 'unicorn'` from your Gemfile
* For Rails apps only:
  * Remove `gem 'logstasher'` from your Gemfile
  * Remove all `config.logstasher.*` configs from `config/environments/production.rb`
  * If the app has a `config/initializers/logstash.rb` remove it
  * If the app has any of the following (likely in `config/environments/production.rb`), remove it:
    ```rb
    # Use default logging formatter so that PID and timestamp are not suppressed.
    config.log_formatter = ::Logger::Formatter.new

    # Use a different logger for distributed setups.
    # require 'syslog/logger'
    config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Logger.new($stderr))

    $real_stdout = $stdout.clone
    $stdout.reopen($stderr)
    ```
